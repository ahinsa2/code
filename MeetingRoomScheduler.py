'''A company has a list of meetings to be held in a single meeting room. Each meeting has a start time and an end time. You must determine if a person can attend all the meetings without overlap.

Input Example: [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]] â†’ Output: false (because meetings overlap)

Concept: Sorting + Interval Checking

Hint: Sort by start time and check if start[i] < end[i-1].'''
